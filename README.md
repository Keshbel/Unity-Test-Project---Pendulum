# UnityTestProject_Pendulum

Test task in Unity. A swinging pendulum, when you tap on the screen, the ball falls down, getting into one of the sections of the 3x3 matrix. When there are balls of the same color along any straight line (horizontally, vertically, diagonally), they should disappear, giving points for their color (differently for each color).

If the tower is filled without straight lines with the same colors, or becomes more than 3 circles high, then the game is summed up.

The test took about 10 hours to complete.
